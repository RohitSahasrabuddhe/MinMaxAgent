# Fruit Rage

Fruit Rage is an Android game: a spin on the traditional Bejeweled/Candy Crush style of games, with you playing against an AI instead of on your own.

You can customize the number of fruits and size of the square grid you play on.

## Rules
* The goal of the game is simple: score the highest number of points before the board runs out of fruits.
* Earn points by selecting fruits on the board.
* Upon tapping a fruit, that fruit and all  connected fruits disappear, and you get 1 point for each.
* The remaining fruits fall down due to gravity.
* The AI uses Minimax to try to predict your moves to out-score you.
* You take turns until the board is empty.
